# Emissions, Flaring, and Carbon Accounting (Phase 29)

- Objectives: compute and report Scope 1 emissions with regulatory-ready outputs.
- Methods covered: Direct Measurement, Engineering Estimate, Material Balance.
- Versioning: Emission factors are versioned with effective windows and stored with uncertainty.
- Normalization: Readings normalized to std conditions (15°C, 1 atm) with unit rigor.
- Aggregations: Hourly → Daily → Monthly with confidence bands via uncertainty propagation.
- Security: Immutable ledger with hash chain; signer roles and factor edit approvals.

Appendix maps to OGMP 2.0, EU ETS-like, and EPA methodologies.
