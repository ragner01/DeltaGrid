# Cost Attribution Policy (Phase 31)

- Inputs: WOs, materials, labor mapped to GL and cost centers with period FX conversion.
- Attribution drivers: runtime, throughput, headcount, tag-based weights.
- Period close: versioned runs, re-open allowed, fully auditable.
- KPIs: $/BOE, $/well/day, cost per failure mode.
- Reconciliation: ERP totals vs allocated totals, exception lists.
