# Phase 21 MLOps — Quick Follow-ups

## Immediate Actions
- [ ] Wire OpenTelemetry exporters in each service for model inference traces
- [ ] Stand up ADF/Databricks jobs per lakehouse contracts
- [ ] Start initial model pipeline (e.g., ESP failure prediction) per MLOps plan

## Medium-term Enhancements
- [ ] Model registry with versioning and artifact signing
- [ ] A/B and shadow deployment infrastructure
- [ ] Automated drift detection alerts
- [ ] Feedback loop instrumentation for operator outcomes

## Production Readiness
- [ ] Model cards for each deployed model with data prerequisites
- [ ] Reproducibility checks and regression test suites
- [ ] Fairness and variance testing frameworks
- [ ] Auto-retrain hooks with manual approval gates
